Delivered undergraduate lectures from February 2018 to June 2020 in the Department of Computer Science Engineering at Universidad del Valle, La Paz, Bolivia.

### Mathematics for Computer Science (*Matemática Computacional*) 
- First-semester undergraduate course that introduces foundational mathematical concepts for computer science. Topics include propositional logic, set theory, functions and relations, matrices, sequences, series, and number systems.
- Course delivered during semesters 1/2018, 1/2019, and 1/2020.


### Statistics for Computer Science (*Estadística Computacional*)  
- Fifth-semester undergraduate course introducing fundamental statistical methods relevant to computer science. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability theory, distributions, regression, least squares, and basic statistical programming.  
- Course delivered during semesters 1/2019 and 1/2020.

### Software Engineering (*Ingeniería de Software*)  
- Fourth-semester undergraduate course covering the principles and practices of software development. Topics include the software development life cycle (SDLC), requirements engineering, and an introduction to object-oriented theory and Unified Modeling Language (UML), including structural and behavioral diagrams.  
- Course delivered during semesters 2/2018 and 2/2019.

### Operational Research II (*Investigación Operativa II*)

- Sixth-semester undergraduate course focused on advanced topics in operational research. Topics include network theory, dynamic programming, game theory, Markov chains, and queuing theory, with practical applications in decision-making and optimization. Algorithmic implementations were demonstrated using Python to reinforce the theoretical foundations through practical application.
- Course delivered during semester 2/2018.

### Systems Simulation (*Simulación de Sistemas*)

- Seventh-semester undergraduate course focusing on the modeling and analysis of dynamic systems using simulation techniques. Topics include discrete-event simulation, random variable generation, statistical input and output analysis, and model validation. Simulations were implemented and analyzed using Python.
- Course delivered during semester 1/2019.
