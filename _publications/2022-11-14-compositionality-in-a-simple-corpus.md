We investigate the capacity of neural networks (NNs) to learn compositional structures by focusing on a well-defined simple logical corpus, and on proof-centered compositionality. We conduct our investigation in a minimal setting by creating a simple logical corpus, where all compositionality-related phenomena come from the structure of proofs as all the sentences of the corpus are propositional logic implications. By training NNs on this corpus we test different aspects of compositionality, through variations of proof lengths and permutations of the constants.
