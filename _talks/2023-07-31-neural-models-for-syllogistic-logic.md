**Abstract.** Despite the success of neural networks to perform numerous
cognitive tasks, few studies involving reasoning have been carried out,
and it remains an open question whether neural networks can learn logic.
We study the ability of neural models to learn syllogistic reasoning with
multiple premises. We artificially created a consistent knowledge base, a
set of premises to train neural networks, such that for a given hypothesis,
their task is to select the necessary premises from the knowledge base
to derive the hypothesis, whenever a proof exists. Furthermore, we are
interested to assess how robust our models are in finding proofs mainly
towards the following two scenarios, with more premises than those seen
during training, and when premises are replaced by diï¬€erent equivalent
ones. Thereby, we can determine how well the models generalize by per-
forming compositionality tests in terms of the structure of reasoning.
