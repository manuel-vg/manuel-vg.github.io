I’m a computer scientist and PhD candidate at the University of Warsaw. 
Previously, I lectured at Universidad del Valle in [La Paz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Paz), my hometown. 
Since 2022, I have been teaching an introductory course on deep learning for NLP at the University of Warsaw. 
I am currently affiliated with the [Institute of Fundamental Technological Research (IPPT-PAN)](https://www.ippt.pan.pl/en/), 
where I work on understanding the expressivity and limitations of transformer architectures. 
Broadly, in addition to neural networks, I’m also interested in formal logic, reasoning, and knowledge representation.
