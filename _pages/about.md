## About Me

My name is Manuel. I’m a computer scientist and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Warsaw. My primary research interests lie in artificial intelligence, particularly in formal logic, deep learning, knowledge representation, and automated theorem proving.

I’m passionate about both coding and teaching. I’ve had the opportunity to lecture at Universidad del Valle in La Paz, my hometown. For the past four years, I’ve also been teaching the course *Introduction to Deep Learning for NLP* at the University of Warsaw.
